# SYL Bank Loan Approval Prediction Model

## Project Overview

### Business Overview

SYL Bank is one of Australiaâ€™s largest banks, but they are facing challenges with their manual loan approval process. With a high volume of loan applications, the manual decision-making process has become subjective and time-consuming. To address this, SYL Bank aims to build an automated machine learning solution to assess loan applications and determine the loan grant status objectively.

### Aim

The objective of this machine learning project is to predict loan approval status based on various applicant attributes, such as credit score, past history, and demographic data. By leveraging classification models, we aim to automate the loan approval process and minimize the risk of loss for SYL Bank.

### Loan Approval/Eligibility Problem

This project involves predicting whether a loan should be granted to an individual based on their loan application data. The dataset consists of anonymized synthetic data generated specifically for this project, exhibiting similar characteristics to genuine loan data.

### Data Description

The dataset contains over 100,000 loan records with the following fields:
- Loan ID
- Customer ID
- Loan Status
- Current Loan Amount
- Term (Short-term or Long-term)
- Credit Score
- Years in Current Job
- Home Ownership
- Annual Income
- Purpose of the Loan
